Introduction
============


This folder contains several implementations of Chen-Wang-Sherman's model of 
insulin secretion based on kinetic modeling of granule exocytosis as described
by [1]. The goal of all models is to reproduce the paper's Figure 4. 

Where allowed by the underlying language, the models have been decomposed
hierarchically in the following components:

| Component | Description                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Membrane  | A square voltage source                              |
| Calcium   | Calcium dynamics, with two state variables (Cmd, Ci) |
| Granules  | The kinetic chain of granule compartments            |
| ISR       | "Instantaneous" (2-min delayed) secretion delta      |

============

## xpp-aut-original-commented

Original XPP-AUT implementation straight out from ref. [2], with added
comments.


## conversion-matlab/ 

Matlab and Octave implementation.  Use either `ChenModel_run_matlab.m`
or `ChenModel_run_octave.m` depending on the software you are
using. The other files are shared.

Tested in Matlab R2012a and Octave 3.6.2.


## conversion-simulink/

Simulink implementation. Care has been used to allow 
for native code generation. Tested in R2012a.

File | Description
-----|----
chen_init.m		|	Matlab file containing the model's constants. Evaluate this first.
chen_r2.mdl   		| Simulink model
chen_r2_html.zip  	| HTML representation of the model
functions.txt		| Readable content of the FCN blocks



## conversion-modelica/

Modelica implementation. Tested on OpenModelica.  Both code-only
(`HenquinPools_r8.mo`) and an OpenModelica notebook are provided.


## conversion-antimony-sbml/

Antimony and SBML implementations produced by Lucien Smith's
QTAntimony (tested with QTAntimony 2.3 beta).

File | Description 
-----|---------
	4_henquin-pools-toni_r5.ant	| Antimony implementation
	4_henquin-pools-toni_r5.sbml	| Flattened SBML generated by QTAntimony
	NOTES.txt 			| Implementation and compatibility remarks

From Antimony, these models are automatically generated:

* Flat SBML (tested in COPASI 4.8, www.copasi.org, and RoadRunner/SBW Simulation Tool v1.4.4424.32048, sbw.sourceforge.net). See enclosed NOTES.txt file for details.

* Modular SBML, according to the sbml-comp extension.



## conversion-madonna/

Berkeley Madonna implementation (copy and paste the code in
`ChenModel.bm.txt` in the program's Equations panel). Tested with
Madonna v. 9.0.74, JEngine 1.8, JRE 1.6.0 .
