Introduction
============


This folder contains several implementations of Chen-Wang-Sherman's model of 
insulin secretion based on kinetic modeling of granule exocytosis as described
by [1]. The goal of all models is to reproduce the paper's Figure 4. 

Where allowed by the underlying language, the models have been decomposed
hierarchically in the following components:

Component     | Description
--------------|--------------------
Membrane	|A square voltage source
Calcium		|Calcium dynamics, with two state variables (Cmd, Ci)
Granules	|The kinetic chain of granule compartments
ISR		|"Instantaneous" (2-min delayed) secretion delta
