A PharmML rendering of [Chen-Wang-Sherman's
model](http://dx.doi.org/10.1529%2Fbiophysj.107.124990) of insulin
secretion based on kinetic modeling of granule exocytosis.

The conversion occurs automatically relying on the infix2pharmml
converter (http://infix2pharmml.sourceforge.net). Source files are
`functions.i2p` and `structural.i2p`.

This conversion is one of the implementations available at
https://github.com/tonigi/Chen_BiophysJ_2009 . Conversion scripts and
latest version are available there.
