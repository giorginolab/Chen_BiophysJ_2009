A PharmML rendering of Chen-Wang-Sherman's model of insulin secretion
based on kinetic modeling of granule exocytosis.

The generation of PharmML is performed by the infix2pharmml converter
(http://infix2pharmml.sourceforge.net) on the basis of the source
files `functions.i2p` and `structural.i2p` (supplied).

See the repository https://github.com/tonigi/Chen_BiophysJ_2009 for
conversion scripts, the latest version, and conversions into several
other languages.
